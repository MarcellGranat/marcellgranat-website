I had the honor of being invited to present one our current research at the "Data Analysis in Practice" series. This time, the focus was the used car market, but I was able to present our research to interested visitors with a detailed description of the methodology. We are extremely proud of this study because it combines the modern machine learning tools and survival analysis in a complex way to answer a research question that is important to everyone.
